# Recipe Book
This project is a simple recipe book that stores and displays various recipes. Each recipe includes the name of the dish, the cooking time, and a list of ingredients. The recipes are stored in a list of dictionaries, making the data structure both readable and easy to manage.

This structure was chosen for its:

### Readability
Each recipe dictionary has clear and descriptive keys, making it easy to understand the details of each recipe.

### Scalability
A list of dictionaries allows the recipe book to grow easily. New recipes can be added without modifying the existing structure.

### Malleability
Dictionaries are flexible and can be easily modified. If additional information needs to be included in a recipe, new key-value pairs can be added without affecting other recipes.
